              Welcome to HackOdisha 2.0, a hackathon that aims to bring
              creatives and developers together to solve some of the most
              pressing problems faced by communities all over the world. This
              36-hour-long event will bring together technocrats from all over
              the country. The problem statements are stimulating enough for
              programmers who love solving mind-bending problems. Our mission is
              to join creative minds with technical skills to come up with
              innovative ways of using sponsorsâ€™ technologies to develop
              innovative solutions to solve important real-world problems. The
              hackathon is open to experts as well as beginners because
              abstractions are equally important as implementations.
